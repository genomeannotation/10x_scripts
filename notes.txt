Right now our job is to generate the same kinds of intermediate files lachesis does.

*.glm file is a sparse matrix that looks like this:
<contig_a>  <contig_b>  <link_strength>
...

The clustering algorithm simply organizes contigs into chromosome clusters
clusters = [[... contigs in chromosome 1 ...], [... contigs in chromosome 2 ...], ...]

Then the sorting and orienting algorithm starts.
The clusters are used to calculate a chromosome link matrix (ChromLinkMatrix)
